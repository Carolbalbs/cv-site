## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - Static site generator
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- [@tailwindcss/typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) - Typography plugin for Tailwind CSS
- [CareerCanvas](https://github.com/felipecordero/careercanvas) - Custom Hugo theme

## 🏗️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/felipecordero/felipecordero.github.io.git
cd felipecordero.github.io
```

2. Install npm dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## 🚀 Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command runs `hugo server -D`, which starts a local server and includes draft content (content with `draft: true` in the front matter). This is useful for previewing unpublished or in-progress content during development.

The site will be available at `http://localhost:1313`


## 📁 Project Structure

- `assets/` - Contains source files for CSS, JavaScript, and other assets
- `content/` - Contains the content of your site
- `static/` - Contains static files like images
- `themes/careercanvas/` - Contains the CareerCanvas theme
- `config.toml` - Main configuration file
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration


## 🏗️ Building

To build the site for production, you need to:

1. Build the CSS with Tailwind:
```bash
npm run build:css
```

2. Build the site with Hugo:
```bash
npm run build
```

Or you can do both in one command:
```bash
npm run build:css && npm run build
```

The built site will be in the `public/` directory.

Note: The CSS build step is necessary because the site uses Tailwind CSS, which needs to be processed to generate the final CSS file with only the used styles.
